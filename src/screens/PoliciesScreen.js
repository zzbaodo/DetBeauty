              A $50 Non-Refundable deposit is required for all services at DET
              Beauty. This will apply toward the total cost of your appointment.
              Please understand that a deposit is there to ensure that you are
              committed to your appointment, and allows us to dedicate this time
              slot just for you. Deposit can be transferred to a different day,
              granted that the appointment is being rescheduled two days prior
              to the actual date of the appointment.
              <br />
              Upon your arrival at the appointment, if there are conflicting
              issues to the procedure due to you not having fully read, and
              understood the information listed in the Info, FQAs, and Policies,
              then your appointment will be canceled. Another deposit is
              required to make another appointment.

              We will not proceed with the service unless both the color and

              understand the inherent uncertainty in the outcomes of permanent
              makeup, as each clientsâ€™ skin anatomy is different. Because of
